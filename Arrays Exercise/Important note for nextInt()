scanner.nextInt()
DOES NOT read the newline character, 
so if the input looks like this
4
1 5
9 10
31 81
41 20
and we read the 4 using nextInt()
the next line will appear blank, because it will finally read the missed newline

If we insist on using nextInt(), then we need to read the newline separately:

int numberOfLines = sc.nextInt();
sc.nextLine();

and then proceed to read the row with 1 5
